## Ubiquity6 React Coding Exercise

This project contains a newly boostrapped app created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can find the original README generated by CRA in `README_CRA.md`. You can run the app by running 'yarn start'. It supports most ES6 syntax, and will live-reload while developing.
